# 📊 BERT vs FinBERT Sentiment Analysis Comparison

This project compares the performance of BERT and FinBERT on a financial sentiment analysis dataset.
The goal is to evaluate how domain-specific pre-training (FinBERT) improves sentiment classification accuracy compared to general BERT.

### 🔍 Project Objectives

  - Load and preprocess a financial news dataset

  - Run sentiment classification using BERT and FinBERT

  - Compare metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy)

  - Visualize differences in predictions and overall performance

### 📈 Visualizations

The project includes:

  - Performance comparison table

  - Sentiment distribution plots for both models

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

  - Python

  - PyTorch / Transformers

  - Matplotlib / Seaborn

  - Jupyter Notebook
